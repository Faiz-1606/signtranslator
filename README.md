# Sign Bridge - Sign Language Toolkit
**Sign Bridge** is a comprehensive web application designed to bridge communication gaps by providing tools for sign language learning, conversion, and video creation.
 This React-based platform enables users to convert speech or text into expressive sign language animations, learn signs through interactive 3D avatars, and create engaging sign language videos.

## 📋 Project Description

Sign Bridge is a full-featured sign language toolkit that combines cutting-edge web technologies with intuitive design to make sign language accessible to everyone. The application features real-time speech recognition, 3D avatar animations powered by Three.js, and a seamless user experience for learning, converting, and creating sign language content.

### API Integration

The application communicates with a hosted backend API at `https://sign-kit-api.herokuapp.com/sign-kit` for video creation and management features. The frontend can also operate with local animation data for basic conversion and learning features.

### Main Pages

- **Home** (`/sign-kit/home`): Landing page with feature overview and call-to-action
- **Convert** (`/sign-kit/convert`): Real-time speech/text to sign language conversion
- **Learn Sign** (`/sign-kit/learn-sign`): Interactive learning interface for alphabets and words
- **Videos** (`/sign-kit/all-videos`): Browse and view created sign language videos
- **Create Video** (`/sign-kit/create-video`): Create new sign language videos from text/audio
- **Feedback** (`/sign-kit/feedback`): Submit feedback and suggestions
- **Login** (`/sign-kit/login`): User authentication (if implemented)

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 16 LTS or later
- **npm**: Bundled with Node.js
- **Modern Browser**: Chrome or Edge recommended for speech recognition support
  - Speech recognition features require browser support (Chrome, Edge, Safari)
  - 3D graphics require WebGL support (available in all modern browsers)

## Installation

1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows).
2. Change into the client directory:
   ```bash
   cd E:\h1\learnsign\client
   ```
3. Install the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Development Server

1. From `E:\h1\learnsign\client`, start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
2. Wait for the build to finish. The app will automatically open at `http://localhost:3000`.
3. Navigate to the routed pages under the `/sign-kit` prefix, for example:
   - `http://localhost:3000/sign-kit/home`
   - `http://localhost:3000/sign-kit/convert`
   - `http://localhost:3000/sign-kit/learn-sign`

The development server provides hot reloading, so changes to the source files will refresh the browser automatically.

## Production Build

### Web Application

```bash
cd E:\h1\learnsign\client
npm run build
cd C:\Users\faizz\Desktop\signtranslator-master\learnsign\client

The production files will be generated in `client/build/`.

## Configuration

### Mobile Application

#### Android APK
```bash
cd C:\Users\faizz\Desktop\signtranslator-master\sign_bridge_app
flutter build apk --release
```

#### iOS (Mac only)
```bash
cd C:\Users\faizz\Desktop\signtranslator-master\sign_bridge_app
flutter build ios --release
```

The APK will be in `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`.


### Convert Page
- Real-time speech recognition using browser's Web Speech API
- Text input for manual conversion
- 3D avatar selection (xbot or ybot)
- Animation speed and pause duration controls
- Smooth character-by-character sign language animation

### Learn Sign Page
- Interactive alphabet learning (A-Z)
- Common words library (HOME, PERSON, TIME, YOU, etc.)
- 3D avatar demonstrations
- Repeat and practice functionality



## Troubleshooting

- If `npm start` fails, ensure dependencies are installed (`npm install`) and no other process is using port 3000.
- Delete `client/node_modules` and re-run `npm install` if you encounter dependency inconsistencies.
